There is a problem in the configuration of your shell.
Check the MAFFT_BINARIES environmental variable by
$ echo $MAFFT_BINARIES

This variable must be *unset*, unless you have installed MAFFT
with a special configuration.  To unset this variable, type
$ unset MAFFT_BINARIES
or
% unsetenv MAFFT_BINARIES
Then retry
$ mafft input > output

To keep this change permanently, edit setting files
(.bash_profile, .profile, .cshrc, etc) in your home directory
to delete the MAFFT_BINARIES line.
On MacOSX, also edit or remove the .MacOSX/environment.plist file
and then re-login (MacOSX 10.6) or reboot (MacOSX 10.7).

Please send a problem report to katoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp,
if this problem remains.
